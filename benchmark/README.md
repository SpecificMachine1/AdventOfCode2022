#Benchmarking AOC 2022 Solutions

From conversations with other people about the performance of their code, and using [ecraven's r7rs benchmarks](https://ecraven.github.io/r7rs-benchmarks/), this is my attempt at benchmarking the (speed) performance of my solutions on three Scheme implementations:

- [Gauche](https://practical-scheme.net/gauche/man/gauche-refe/index.html) an implementation with a lot of srfis, and an "objects all the way down" object model. It scores lower on the benchmarks than a lot of other implementations, but isalso one of the implementations that seems to consistently adhere to the [r7rs standard](https://standards.scheme.org/unofficial/errata-corrected-r7rs.pdf) including [r7rs large](https://codeberg.org/scheme/r7rs/src/branch/main/ballot-results/jcowan/edition/2016-07-red-edition-report.md) so it is very easy to work with using the standards/srfis.
- [Guile](https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/manual/html_node/index.html) an implementation which has a lot of libraries, but only some srfis. It also seems like it is a very "reach exceeds its grasp" implementation: it's objects almost all the way down, instead of using the standard srfi 115 regex library which has a lot of documentation in the srfi, it has its own,linked to whatever is on the platform, "[a] full description of regular expressions and their syntax is beyond the scope of this manual." Which, I mean, that's GNU, you have to know the lore to get anything done. Etc. But it is a nice implementation to work with and it does have a lot of 3rd party libraries and falls in the middle of the benchmarks
- [Gambit](https://web.archive.org/web/20250709114707/https://gambitscheme.org/latest/manual/) one of the fastest implementations (if compiled to C, but I have to figure that out first) this is the one I've worked with the least. Haven't looked at it's object system much (that was in the beforetimes)
